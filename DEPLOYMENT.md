# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

## âœ… **Completed Pre-Deployment Steps**

### **Build Testing**
- [x] Cook app builds successfully (warning: large bundle ~1.2MB)
- [x] Customer app builds successfully (warning: large bundle ~1.1MB)  
- [x] Admin portal builds successfully (warning: large bundle ~896KB)

### **Error Handling**
- [x] Added ErrorBoundary components to all three apps
- [x] Graceful error messages without technical details
- [x] Recovery options (try again, go home, refresh)

### **Security Hardening**
- [x] Firebase rules deployed with custom claims support
- [x] Admin portal restricted to localhost (127.0.0.1)
- [x] Dev-only features protected with env flags
- [x] No role-revealing error messages
- [x] Upload restrictions (5MB, images only, user-scoped paths)

### **Environment Variables**
- [x] `.env.example` files in all apps
- [x] `.env` files are gitignored
- [x] Admin portal has `.env.local` (needs production equivalent)
- [ ] **NEED**: Production `.env` files with real Firebase config

## ðŸ”§ **Bundle Size Warnings**

All apps show bundle size warnings (>500KB). Consider for post-launch optimization:
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Manual chunk splitting
- Tree shaking optimization

## ðŸ“‹ **Remaining Pre-Launch Tasks**

### **1. Production Environment Setup**
```bash
# Create production .env files for each app:
# cook-app/.env.production
# customer-app/.env.production  
# admin-portal/.env.production

# Required variables:
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_production_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_production_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=hometaste-aaba7
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_production_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_key
```

### **2. Firebase Project Settings**
- [ ] Enable Authentication methods (Email/Password)
- [ ] Set up authorized domains for production URLs
- [ ] Configure CORS for your domains
- [ ] Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules`

### **3. Performance Optimization (Optional)**
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Implement image compression
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better UX

### **4. Production Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting)
- [ ] Set up custom domains
- [ ] Configure CDN/caching
- [ ] Set up monitoring/error tracking

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Recommendations**

### **Manual Testing Priority**
1. **Authentication flow** (signup, login, logout)
2. **File uploads** (images, size limits, permissions)
3. **Cross-app functionality** (cook creates menu â†’ customer orders â†’ admin views)
4. **Mobile responsiveness**
5. **Error scenarios** (network offline, permission denied)

### **User Acceptance Testing**
- [ ] Cook onboarding flow
- [ ] Customer ordering flow  
- [ ] Admin management tasks
- [ ] Real-time notifications

## ðŸ”’ **Security Verification**

```bash
# Run these checks before going live:
cd /workspaces/food-delivery-platform

# 1. No secrets committed
git ls-files | grep -E "\.env(\.|$)" # Should be empty

# 2. No hardcoded API keys
grep -r "AIza" */client/ */src/ # Should be empty

# 3. All apps use same Firebase project
grep -r "VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID" */.*env* # Should all show hometaste-aaba7
```

## âš¡ **Ready for Testing!**

Your apps are **production-ready** for user testing with these caveats:
- Set up production Firebase environment variables
- Deploy security rules to production Firebase project
- Create your first admin user via the seeding script

The core security, error handling, and functionality are solid. Bundle optimization can be done post-launch.
